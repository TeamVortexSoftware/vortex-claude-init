# Alternative: No Reload Required

## The Issue
VS Code requires a reload to pick up new slash commands, which adds friction.

## Alternative Approach

Instead of a slash command, we could:

1. **Create a visible file** that customers can open
2. **Put instructions in that file** that tell me (Claude Code) what to do
3. **Customer just opens the file and asks me to follow it**

### Example Flow

```bash
# Customer runs init
npx @teamvortexsoftware/vortex-claude init

# This creates: .vortex/INTEGRATE_NOW.md
# With content like:

---
# Vortex Integration Instructions for Claude Code

Claude, please integrate Vortex into this codebase using these credentials:
- API Key: vortex_12345...
- Widget ID: widget_abc...

[Full integration instructions here...]
---

# Then customer just:
# 1. Opens .vortex/INTEGRATE_NOW.md
# 2. Asks: "Claude, follow the instructions in this file"
# 3. Done! No reload needed!
```

## Pros
✅ No VS Code reload required
✅ Customer can see the instructions
✅ Customer can edit/customize before running
✅ Works with any AI assistant (not just Claude Code)

## Cons
❌ Less "magical" than slash command
❌ One extra step (open file, ask Claude)
❌ Instructions visible in project (could add to .gitignore)

## Recommendation

**Stick with slash command** because:
- Reload is a minor inconvenience (5 seconds)
- Slash command is cleaner/more professional
- It's how VS Code extensions work
- Once reloaded, it's instant forever

**BUT** we could support both:
- Create `.vortex/INTEGRATE_NOW.md` for immediate use (no reload)
- Create `.claude/commands/integrate-vortex.md` for future use (after reload)

Then customer can choose:
- Impatient: Open `.vortex/INTEGRATE_NOW.md` and ask me to follow it
- Patient: Reload and use `/integrate-vortex` (cleaner)
